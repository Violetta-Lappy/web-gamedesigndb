A Game Design Document (GDD) is a highly descriptive living software design document of the design for a video game. A GDD is created and edited by the development team and it may include a concept and proposal of the game, mechanics, story, characters, abstract representation of game state, etc¹²⁴⁶. Here's a basic structure of a GDD:

1. **Executive Summary**: This includes the game concept, genre, target audience, project scope, etc⁵.
2. **Gameplay**: This section describes the objectives, game progressions, in-game GUI, etc⁵.
3. **Mechanics**: This section includes rules, combat, physics, etc⁵.
4. **Game Elements**: This section includes worldbuilding, story, characters, locations, level design, etc⁵.
5. **Assets**: This section includes music, sound effects, 2D/3D models, etc⁵.
6. **Interface & Controls**³.
7. **Visual Style**³.
8. **Music & Sound**³.

Remember that a GDD is not set in stone and it can evolve over time as the game development progresses¹. It's important to keep it up-to-date and make sure it's easily searchable, readable, and concise so that it can be an incredibly valuable resource for you and your team¹.

The game design market is continuously growing and offers numerous opportunities for game designers, developers, animators, and modelers¹. Here are some key points to consider for a market analysis in a game design document:

1. **Industry Overview**: The video game industry is one of the few markets that continue to grow, even during economic recessions¹. This growth is driven by advancements in technology that deliver new and exciting ways to entertain users¹.

2. **Job Market**: The next five years look promising for those interested in a career in gaming¹. Big studios are hiring more junior designers than ever, both for new IP and to add insight to existing franchises¹. There are also more roles for senior developers as teams of junior developers grow¹.

3. **Salary Overview**: The average salary for a game designer ranges from $60,131 for 0-1 years of experience to $81,474 for 15+ years of experience¹. For a lead game designer, the salary ranges from $77,303 for 0-1 years of experience to $107,186 for 15+ years of experience¹.

4. **Top Companies**: Some of the best game design companies include BioWare, Zynga, Electronic Arts, Valve Corporation, Gameloft, Rockstar Games, Microsoft Corporation, Naughty Dog Inc, Activision Blizzard, and Ubisoft¹.

5. **Game Analysis**: When analyzing a game for design purposes, it's important to consider what is actually present in the game rather than what you think should be². This includes understanding the formal elements such as the number of players supported, objectives/goals of the players, and rules/mechanics of the game².

Remember that this is just a starting point. A comprehensive market analysis should also include competitor analysis, target audience analysis, trends in the gaming industry, and potential opportunities and threats.

Unique Selling Points (USPs) are the factors that differentiate a product or service from its competition. In the gaming industry, a USP answers, "How is your game better than the others out there?"¹. Here are some things to consider when defining the USPs for a game:

1. **Studio Overview**: Highlight your studio's ideas, strengths, and weaknesses. Assess your dev team to see what extra skills and technologies you need to invest in to ensure you can meet the needs of modern games and gamers¹.

2. **Role in the Gaming Industry**: Many games are built on the success of other titles, and the secret has been to find a role in a specific niche and play it well¹. Work with your dev team to find what your target audience wants to see and craft a USP that signifies your promise to address those issues¹.

3. **Game Niche**: What part of your game addresses that niche? This could be anything from unique gameplay mechanics, innovative storytelling, exceptional graphics, or even a unique multiplayer experience¹.

4. **Target Audience**: Understand who you're targeting. This could be "indie gamers", "gamers interested in something different and arty", non-gamers who like beautiful things, or casual gamers².

5. **Points of Difference**: Determine what makes your game different from similar games in the market². This could be anything from unique gameplay elements, art style, story elements, or even how players interact with the game².

Remember, a successful USP communicates what makes your game different and desirable in a few words or an entire paragraph¹. It's not just a tagline but a promise to solve the problems consumers face in the best possible way¹.

Sure, here are some examples of successful Unique Selling Points (USPs) in video games:

1. **Bioshock**: The unique selling point of Bioshock is its setting. The game is set underwater, which provides a unique and immersive environment that sets it apart from other games⁶.

2. **Bioshock Infinite**: Similar to Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite's USP is also its setting. However, instead of being underwater, it's set up above in the sky⁶.

3. **Project Ascension**: This game has several USPs, including environments and architecture that animate beautifully in response to player action, a beautiful, seamless, and atmospheric experience of continuous ascension, and unique puzzle-solving about positioning, line of sight, and environmental/structural manipulation⁷.

Remember, a successful USP communicates what makes your game different and desirable in a few words or an entire paragraph¹. It's not just a tagline but a promise to solve the problems consumers face in the best possible way¹.
