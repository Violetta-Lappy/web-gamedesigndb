## Fandom
OMORI is a surreal psychological horror RPG Maker game developed by OMOCAT and co-published by PLAYISM which fully released for PC Windows and macOS on December 25, 2020.

The Nintendo Switch and Xbox One port released on June 17, 2022 and the Playstation 4 released on June 24, 2022, while the Japanese port for PC and macOS released on December 16, 2021.[1]

It is directed, written, and illustrated independently by OMOCAT and their TEAM, including music by SLIME GIRLS and CLOVER & SEALIFE. The 2020 trailer music was written by bansheebeat (Dylan Browne) and composed by Pedro Silva.

The game was successfully funded on June 5, 2014 via Kickstarter. A Nintendo 3DS port stretch goal for the game was funded, but it was later announced at PLAYISM's pre-Tokyo Game Show 2019 that this port was cancelled and replaced by a Nintendo Switch port.

The game is based around several previous works by OMOCAT, including OMORI'S BLOG, OMORI'S STORY, OMORI'S SKETCHBOOK, and an unfinished graphic novel. The game focuses on OMORI, a depressed young boy, going on adventures with his friends and helping others in the world. He wonders why his friends would want to be with someone horrible like him, but OMORI recalls a time when he was not like this. He also seems to have forgotten something... or someone... very important.

OMORI is heavily inspired by the Mother series, specifically EarthBound and Mother 3, as well as Yume Nikki, another independent horror RPGMaker game. The art direction combines pixel art with hand-drawn art. The overworld and its characters are represented with pixel art while enemy battles, images of items, and important cut scenes are represented with hand-drawn illustrations.

While OMORI has already been released, any future updates for the game will be posted to the OMORI GAME official website or any listed social media.
